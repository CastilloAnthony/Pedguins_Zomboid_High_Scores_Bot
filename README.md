# Pedguin_Zomboid_High_Scores_Bot
## Developed by Peter Mann (Pedguin) and Anthony Castillo (ComradeWolf)

A personalized discord bot made using the discord 2.6.4 library alongside the mcrcon 0.7.0 library for direct interactions with the Project Zomboid server and the paramiko 4.0.0 library for communicating with the host of the server. Includes custom slash prefixed commands, logging, and files for inputting your own authentication information.

### QuickStart:
1. Install requirements.txt using pipreqs (pip install -r requirements.txt)
2. Launch bot.py
3. Fill out the newly created settings_connection.json and settings_discord.json with your appropriate information.
4. Relaunch bot.py
5. You should now be able to interact with the bot in chat channels. Try the '!help' command.

## Todo:
- Implement a truncate pz_perk_log.json feature
- Connect to PZ server and pull data generated by https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3671640779
- Fix hoursSurvived not being saved (Possibly fixed with the task above).
- Remove anomalous player data (i.e. entries where the username is actually their steam_id)
- Twitch bot to say deaths in twitch chat
